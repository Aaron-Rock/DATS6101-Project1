# The package "ezids" (EZ Intro to Data Science) includes a lot of the helper functions we developed for the course.
# Some of the frequently used functions are loadPkg(), xkabledply(), xkablesummary(), uzscale(), etc.
# Once installed, load the library.
library(ezids)
# some of common options (and the defaults) are:
# include=T, eval=T, echo=T, results='hide'/'asis'/'markup',..., collapse=F, warning=T, message=T, error=T, cache=T, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, fig.dim=c(6,4) #inches, fig.align='left'/'center','right',
# knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = F, results = "markup", message = F)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = F, results = "hide", message = F)
# knitr::opts_chunk$set(include = F)
# knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
options(scientific=T, digits = 3)
# options(scipen=9, digits = 3)
# 1. Answer each question using in words/paragraph.
# 2. DO NOT use comments inside code blocks (like here) to answer anything. Those are for notes between coders/self. They
# will be ignored, and not counted as answers.
# 3. Keep the line/option    knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = F, results = "hide", message = F)
# You can temporarily turn this on/off and use other option while you are working on the homework if it helps.
# The submitted work should have this option selected instead.
# 4. All charts/graphs/tables should have appropriate captions.
# This is coder's comments
# Since my RMD and csv files are in the same working directory, I do not need to give the full path to the csv file. Alternatively, you can use the functions getwd() and setwd() to handle it.
baseball <- data.frame(read.csv("BaseballHeightWeight.csv"))
# baseballdf <- read.csv("BaseballHeightWeight.csv")
# You can compare the two above lines, and look at the object called baseball in the "Environment" on the upper right.
# Turns out either method gives the same result. In some cases (depending on the .csv file), they might differ. To be safe, I usually use data.frame( ) afterwards.
# need results="asis" to overwrite the default, and show the result block in Html/pdf
